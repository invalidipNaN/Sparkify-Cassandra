# Sparkify-Cassandra
### Project Summary
In this project, we build an ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model. 

The data is then inserted into Apache Cassandra tables.
We make queries to select data from Apache Cassandra tables. 

Remember that with Apache Cassandra we need two create the tables according to the queries we intend to make.
